# Hexapod

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi folder contains 'camera.py' and 'pi_therm_cam.py' files for capturing data from the camera and thermal camera. The 'server.py' file sends the camera and thermal camera images to the website and receives commands from the site.

The Arduino folder contains two files, each used to control 3 motors. This project uses two Arduino Nano boards.

## Credits

the pi_therm_cam file has been retrieved from the repository at the link below and modified. I recommend you to take a look at this great repo by Ryan Brideau for MLX90640 thermal camera.
