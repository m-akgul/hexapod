# Hexapod

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi folder contains camera.py and pi_therm_cam.py files for capturing data from the camera and thermal camera. The server.py file sends the camera and thermal camera images to the website and receives commands from the site.

The Arduino folder contains two files, each used to control 3 motors. This project uses two Arduino Nano boards.
